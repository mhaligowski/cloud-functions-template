# Template for creating Google Cloud Functions

## Usage

* `npm install`
* `gulp` runs tests and copies the js files to `dist` folder, along with `package.json`, so you can deploy it without problems to Google Cloud Functions
* `index.js` file contains the function, remember to change the name.

## TODO

* verify on projects with multiple files
